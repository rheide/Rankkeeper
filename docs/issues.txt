Big issues
- Paste url: which media type is it?
   - We need to let the user pick status!
- Business key generation for media
   - How to generate unique key for each media type?
   - Key generation different for each media type?
   - Who is responsible? Each website importer? Or a base class? Or a base class per media type?
- How to merge media?
   - Is media merging necessary? If the business key is chosen correctly there should not be a need for merging
   - ..except for merging MediaList source media with other source media?
- Do we let users input their own media unsourced? And how?
   - Let them generate a unique business key?
   - How can this be done elegantly and smoothly, without asking the user to fill in a bunch of items every time they want to add media?
   - A search function that matches stuff in a smart way? - eg. when a single partial match is found, add a rating? or just show a list of media instead that can be clicked on. but what if the user wants to insert a new item?

Summary:
- Insert from URL: which media type?
- Cross-site unique media-type-dependent identifier key generation
- Adding new media: how to add new stuff quickly and efficiently?
- Avoid storing of information about media at all costs! 
    - Duration?
    - Author/ Actors? 
    - Year/Date of release

* javascript client-side url parsers
   - detect url, load media types
   - if url not supported, display message
* generic unique key builder class 
   - supply it with media type, it will tell you which fields are required
   - supply it with values for unique fields, it will give you a key


Big question: if I do all this, will I be satisfied enough with my website that I will use it for my own purposes instead of all those other websites?
