This is the source code of the server on www.moodlogger.net. 

Note: this is a dead project. I do not have time to work on this any more. This project was a great learning experience for me and basically taught me how to use Django. If you feel like cloning the site and making an exact copy I welcome it. I hope it can be of use to someone.

This project contains:
- The usual views and models
- A horrible IMDB scraper that I am very ashamed of having written
- A framework for adding scrapers for other websites (that I never got around to using)
- An Ajax rating framework basically copied from www.anime-planet.com, but with the added option of being able to rate a media more than once.
- Some backend utilities to periodically scrape imdb pages, update search indexes and make database backups
- A bunch of third-party libraries that each have their own copyright.
